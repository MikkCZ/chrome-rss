RSS Subscription Extension
=========

**Unmaintained:** I have decided not to progress with the work, as other extensions with better codebase appeared in the meantime (e.g. [Awesome RSS](https://github.com/shgysk8zer0/awesome-rss)). If someone is interested in resurrecting this, here are some issues that I have [never implemented](https://github.com/MikkCZ/page-action-rss/issues?q=label%3A%22never+implemented%22+is%3Aclosed).

This is a fork of the RSS Subscription Extension by Justin Kelly (forked from discontinued extension by Google).

~~At this moment I am working on porting it to Firefox to add a subscribe page action button ([Bug 1375687](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1375687)).~~

This original extension is published on the chrome webstore at:
